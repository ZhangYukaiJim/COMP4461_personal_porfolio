## About Me

I am a final year undergraduate student major in ISD and COMP at HKUST. I share my interest in computer vision, product design, and robotics. Having experiences in programming and design, I am very attracted to the area of Human-Computer Interaction. I wish to learn more about HCI and I am looking forward to work on interesting projects in this course!
