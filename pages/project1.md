## Overview
Students often find themselves feel sleepy in confined classroom during long lectures. This is partly due to CO<sub>2</sub> accumulating in the classroom. In this project, we investigated the problem through interview and designed FO<sub>2</sub>CUS, a smart classroom system that display CO<sub>2</sub> level in real-time alerts students and teachers when CO<sub>2</sub> concentration rises beyond the healthy level.

## Background
At HKUST, there is no window in most classrooms and the circulation of air depends entirely on the ventilation system. Our experience and observation show that classroom is not well ventilated: students often feel drowsiness during long lectures and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in classroom can reach 5000 ppm, much higher than the healthy level of 1000 ppm while high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration leads to lower cognitive capability.

## Need
We interviewed students at HKUST from different grades and majors to understand their needs regarding the issue. We asked if they have ever experienced tiredness, sleepiness or other comfortableness at HKUST campus and how do they resolve the problem. 



Most interviewees said they have experienced sleepiness during face-to-face lectures for various reasons.  Some of them said a break during the lecture would help, but they felt embarrassed to interrupt the lecture by asking for a break.

*User Persona*

With the information collected from interviews, we created persona for our target user and formulated our problem statement:
How might we keep students focused during lectures by maintaining CO2 level in a reasonable range without requiring any embarrassing actions? 

## Concept Ideation
Based on the interview, we summarized all the actions that students and professors can take to ventilate the classroom during a long lecture, and we then constructed a Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) framework to explore the design opportunities to tackle the problem we have identified.

To facilitate innovation, we brainstormed product concepts and features that could potentially solve the problem. We also adopted MoSCoW to organize features.

## The Concept
Our concept a smart classroom system called FO<sub>2</sub>CUS. Its main component is a clock embedded with sensor and real time display for CO<sub>2</sub>.
